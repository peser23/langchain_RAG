      "Yes, the topic of nuclear fusion was mentioned in the video. The discussion focused on the collaboration with EPFL in Switzerland, where a test reactor was used to explore bottleneck problems in fusion. The speaker described how they applied AI methods to address these challenges, particularly in controlling and holding plasma in specific shapes for extended periods, which is crucial for energy production. They mentioned a published paper on this work and expressed interest in collaborating with fusion startups to tackle further problems in the field. The speaker also highlighted the broader implications of using AI in energy and climate challenges, indicating that fusion is one area where AI could be transformative.\n"
